Also you should declare all functions that you don't want to leak to the outside world as `static`.\n\nSee [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63444418/gcc-how-to-create-an-so-from-a-source-file-and-other-o-files) in case you want to build a shared library. \n\nSee also [How do you actually use a C library? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1749079/how-do-you-actually-use-a-c-library).\n**Important note** - you can actually redefine functions from a library. Functions from libraries are used only when they're not found in your code. See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24390267/why-redefinition-of-a-function-which-is-already-present-in-dynamic-or-static-lib).\n\nIf a function is contained in two static libraries and you use both of them, then the implementation which comes in the **first** included library will be used. Weird.\nUPD: I think it's important how your object files are named. If the function is contained in both libraries, but the object files are named different, there **will** be a multiple declaration error.\n### Headers\n[[Makefile#d files]]\n\n### Other thingies\n- [[C compilation and debugging]]\n- [[Meson build system]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.342603643Z","tags":null},"/C++":{"title":"C++","content":"\nAn extension of [[C (language)|C]].\n\n### To-do\nCERN has C++ repl?\nMove semantics.\n\n### Links\n- [–£—Ä–æ–∫–∏ –ø–æ –°++ –¥–ª—è –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞—é—â–∏—Ö / Ravesli](https://ravesli.com/uroki-cpp/)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.342603643Z","tags":null},"/C-and-C++-lingo":{"title":"C and C++ lingo","content":"\n### declaration vs definition\nDeclaration - you're telling the compiler \"there's something with this name, and it has this type\".

And that‚Äôs not a knock on my education ‚Äî it provided me with a lot of the tools I needed to get started. It‚Äôs my job to continue to grow and become a better developer.\n\nAccording to [The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) [Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming):\n\n\u003e **Declarative programming** is a programming paradigm ‚Ä¶ that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.\n\u003e \n\u003e **Imperative programming** is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program‚Äôs state.\n\n‚ÄúProgramming Paradigm‚Äù sounds super pretentious and is definitely a phrase some of my college profs _loved._ If you‚Äôve had a formal CS education, these definitions may not be that cryptic, but still I find that examples go a long way in helping.\n\nBefore I get too far though, I want to stress that there is nothing wrong with either of these approaches. They absolutely have strengths and weaknesses, but one approach will always be right. For instance, declarative programming can result in less direct control, which may not be correct for applications like embedded systems where [‚Äúthe right answer delivered too late becomes the wrong answer.‚Äù](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\u0026rct=j\u0026q=\u0026esrc=s\u0026source=web\u0026cd=2\u0026cad=rja\u0026uact=8\u0026ved=0ahUKEwjGvp7d-Z3SAhVJ_WMKHftKBgQQFggjMAE\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fcacm.acm.org%2Fmagazines%2F2002%2F6%2F7037-middleware-for-real-time-and-embedded-systems%2Ffulltext\u0026usg=AFQjCNEtH_D9tnPbEvM3MB9oetQb7nm-3Q)\n\nAlright here‚Äôs a metaphor.\n\nDeclarative Programming is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. You don‚Äôt care how they draw it, that‚Äôs up to them.\n\nImperative Programming is like your friend listening to Bob Ross tell them how to paint a landscape. While good ole Bob Ross isn‚Äôt exactly commanding, he is giving them step by step directions to get the desired result.\n\nAlright, alright, here‚Äôs some code examples. Here we just have a button that changes it‚Äôs color on click. I‚Äôll start with the imperative example:\n```Javascript\nconst container = document.getElementById(‚Äòcontainer‚Äô);  \nconst btn = document.createElement(‚Äòbutton‚Äô);btn.className = ‚Äòbtn red‚Äô;  \nbtn.onclick = function(event) {  \n if (this.classList.contains(‚Äòred‚Äô)) {  \n   this.classList.remove(‚Äòred‚Äô);  \n   this.classList.add(‚Äòblue‚Äô);  \n } else {  \n   this.classList.remove(‚Äòblue‚Äô);  \n   this.classList.add(‚Äòred‚Äô);  \n }  \n};container.appendChild(btn);\n```\nAnd our declarative React example:\n```JSX\nclass Button extends React.Component{ this.state = { color: 'red' } handleChange = () =\u003e {  \n    const color = this.state.color === 'red' ? 'blue' : 'red';  \n    this.setState({ color });  \n  } render() {  \n    return (\u003cdiv\u003e  \n      \u003cbutton   \n         className=\\`btn ${this.state.color}\\`  \n         onClick={this.handleChange}\u003e  \n      \u003c/button\u003e  \n    \u003c/div\u003e);  \n  }  \n}\n```\nThe differences here may be subtle. We still have logic that says if red then blue, but there‚Äôs one huge difference. The React example never actually touches an element. it simply declares an element _should_ be rendered given our current state. It does not actually manipulate the DOM itself.\n\nReaching for direct DOM manipulation is a mistake I felt myself making often when I first started working with React. It‚Äôs also a problem I‚Äôve noticed in developers coming from a background that‚Äôs heavy in jQuery.\n\nWhen writing React, it‚Äôs often good not to think of _how_ you want to accomplish a result, but instead _what_ the component should look like in it‚Äôs new state. This sets us up for a good control flow where state goes through a series of predictable and replicable mutations. This doesn‚Äôt just apply to components either, but also to application state. Libraries like [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) will help enforce this method of architecting, but they aren‚Äôt necessary to achieve it.\n\nTo me, application structure is the most important consideration when you want to embrace a declarative approach. It‚Äôs often easy to follow on a single component, but becomes harder at scale. It‚Äôs tempting to make two components communicate with each other in a hacky way, or to settle for passing information only halfway back up the tree. But a consistent approach to state management will make your application easier to reason about as a whole.\n\nI‚Äôve either made, or allowed all of these mistakes in code I‚Äôve worked on. They‚Äôre just pieces of advice; do with them what you will.\n\n-   Avoid Refs. Sure, sometimes they‚Äôre necessary, but if you feel yourself reaching for refs then it can often mean you‚Äôre doing something wrong. (There are some legitimate uses for refs in the [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)).\n-   Attempting to manipulate DOM directly (this goes _very_ closely with Refs)\n-   Instead of returning functions that render a component, prefer to return functions that return the necessary information to render a component. In the first we are instructing what to do(render precisely this thing), while in the second we‚Äôre just returning some information (use this information to do something).\n-   Communicating between siblings, instead of through components. Try to _only_ communicate with other components through props.\n-   Use pure functional components where possible. Because these components don‚Äôt have lifecycle methods, they require you to rely on a declarative, props-based approach. And they can also provide performance improvements.e\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.342603643Z","tags":null},"/Dementia":{"title":"Dementia","content":"\n### Articles\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/even-mild-brain-injuries-raise-the-risk-of-dementia\nand even single, but I've lost the article.

So today, I decided to do some research and (try to) understand what are the main differences.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with some definitions:\n\n\u003e ‚Äú **Functional programming** (**FP**) is a programming paradigm ‚Äî a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs ‚Äî that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.‚Äù ‚Äî [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)\n\u003e\n\u003e ‚Äú **Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of ‚Äúobjects‚Äù, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as _attributes;_ and code, in the form of procedures, often known as _methods.‚Äù ‚Äî_ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)\n\u003e\n\u003e ‚Äú **Procedural programming** is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the _procedure call_. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.‚Äù ‚Äî [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)\n\nOk, so that‚Äôs an introduction but let‚Äôs go in a little bit more details.\n\nFirst, what is a programming paradigm? It is a style of programming, a way of thinking about software construction. A programming paradigm does not refer to a specific language but rather to a way to program, a methodology. Some languages make it easy to write in some paradigms but not others. For more details, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm).\n\nNow let‚Äôs dive into the three programming paradigms that interest us today:\n\nProcedural programming (PP), also known as inline programming takes a top-down approach. It is about writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. It relies on procedures or routines.\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is about encapsulating data and behavior into objects. An OOP application will use a collection of objects which knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the application. For example an object could be a person. That person would have a name (that would be a property of the object), and would know how to walk (that would be a method). A method in OOP can be considered as a procedure in PP, but here it belongs to a specific object. Another important aspect of OOP are classes. A class can be considered as a blueprint for an object.\n\nFunctional programming (FP) is about passing data from function to function to function to get a result. In FP, functions are treated as data, meaning you can use them as parameters, return them, build functions from other functions, and build custom functions. Functions in FP have to be pure functions, they should avoid shared state, and side effects and data should be immutable. A pure function is a function that given the same type of input will always return the same output, it is not dependent on a local or global state. A shared state is a state that is shared between more than one function or more than one data-structure. So with shared state, in order to understand the effects of a function, you need to know all the details of every shared variable. It adds a lot of complexity and permits less modularity.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.342603643Z","tags":null},"/GDB":{"title":"GDB","content":"\n### See also\n- [[GDB pretty-printing]]\n- [[LLDB]]\n\n### General\n- Compile with `-g` or `-ggdb` flag to include debug information in the executable\n- `gdb --args prog arg1 arg2 arg3` to pass arguments\n- Use `start` to execute the program step by step, or `run` to just run\n- `next` or `n` - for next instruction. \n- `Enter` to repeat the last command\n- `p \u003cvariable\u003e` to print variables, `display \u003cvariable\u003e` to print it continuously\n- `step` or `s` to step into functions. `finish` to finish the stepped-into function\n- `backtrace` or `bt` for backtrace\n- `ctrl + x, 1` or `tui enable` to enable text text user interface.\n- `br` to set breakpoints. `br some_func` or `br some_file.c:42`\n- `info args` for info about program arguments, `info breakpoints` for breakpoints\n- `set follow-fork-mode child` - follow the forked process instead of parent when using `fork()`\n- `set foo=bar` - change variables at runtime!

The reverse `log2` also exist.\n- `mix` function doesn't clamp *a* (the last value)! So if it's greater than 1, the second color gets multiplied. Because it's implemented like this: $$(1-a)x+ay$$\n- [[GLSL compilation]]\n\n### To process #todo\n#### Shaders\n- Flipping tiles (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtS3Dt)\n- Geometric Grid Pattern (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Wdd3DX)\n- Portal 2 Box Flip Rotation (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltBcD3)\n#### Box formula by [[Shane]]\nThis renders a horizontal or vertical box-line from point `a` to point `b` with a line width of `w`. It's different to the the usual line formula because it doesn't render the rounded caps on the end. Sometimes, you don't want those. It utilizes IQ's box formula and was put together in a hurry, so I'd imagine there are more efficient ways to do the same, but it gets the job done. I put together a more generalized angular line formula as well.\n```C\nfloat lBoxHV(vec2 p, vec2 a, vec2 b, float w){\n    \n   vec2 l = abs(b - a); // Box-line length.\n   p -= vec2(mix(a.x, b.x, .5), mix(a.y, b.y, .5)); // Positioning the box center.\n   \n   // Applying the above to IQ's box distance formula.\n   vec2 d = abs(p) - (l + w)/2.; \n   return min(max(d.x, d.y), 0.) + length(max(d, 0.));\n}\n```\n\n### Related\n- [[GLSL and graphics programming resources]]\n- [[Colors]]\n- [[THREE.js]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/GLSL-and-graphics-programming-resources":{"title":"GLSL and graphics programming resources.md","content":"\n### Resources\n#todo This can quickly become bloated\n- General\n\t- https://graphicscodex.courses.nvidia.com/app.html\n\t- https://wiki.genclub.club/\n\t- https://webgl-shaders.com/about.html #list\n\t- http://roy.red/ many mathy things\n- GLSL\n\t- Raymarching\n\t\t- [Generating fractals](https://neort.io/product/bvcrf5s3p9f7gigeevf0)\n\t\t- https://github.com/electricsquare/raymarching-workshop\n\t\t- https://9bitscience.blogspot.com/2013/07/raymarching-distance-fields_14.html?m=1\n\t\t- http://blog.hvidtfeldts.net/index.php/category/fractals/\n\t- Simulations\n\t\t- https://michaelmoroz.github.io/Reintegration-Tracking/\n- [[OpenGL]]\n\n### Programs\n- http://glslsandbox.com/\n\t- [with DAT gui](http://www.backtothepixel.com/apps/GLSLSandboxHack/index.html#XQAAAQCQAQAAAAAAAAARmkjGWrWuwfkQ94Df3-Rz5ZmiEakDBKtqpYGzQrNE205xCZvreTUrPEQsje6XD_tNBUSR41a09ViCwvNVQ5P-ZmLPLDSKP1HczntXYCkLvFwbkXFGVxaRA2gFuscEtMs2RZyeCB8HAOQ_BVYmDAQtUF4Cd3VcuERWpmBMHlVAB6gixoULSIQm4D8XdUxB2QlGLx1ybXFDR_UC08wVwFpGVKsgObT1B6UV4hw2OPBSvidCWtC9NoWGax15AKT1euXBI1yzIRSGkTAjSs9seAof8LXe59SYHiEtpz2PeaS1pziErcYyd7JDJH0JkqAhzXW9yFEFiRWx4OCojbr5XorJfSbpshB-Aivm_xG1YwA,)\n- [[TouchDesigner]]\n- [[Material Maker]] - compose shaders, super good!\n- [[cables.gl]]\n- [[ShaderED]]\n- [[Shadertoy]]\n- [[Blender]]\n- [ISF Editor](https://isf.vidvox.net/desktop-editor/)\n- [Shader Frog](https://shaderfrog.com/)\n\t- WebGL, online\n\t- Node-based\n- http://shdr.bkcore.com/\n- http://glslsandbox.com/\n- https://www.vertexshaderart.com/\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.342603643Z","tags":null},"/GLSL-compilation":{"title":"GLSL compilation","content":"\nThe compiler usually tries to unroll loops for performance gain, but if there are too many cycles, the code can get too long and overwhelm the GPU.

There are many different Linux signals, but a few stand out and are important to understand and know: SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL. Here‚Äôs how they work.\n\n## What Is a _Linux Signal_?\n\nWe all understand a red light means that we have to stop walking or driving. Similarly, in Linux and Unix systems, one can pass a signal to a running program or service to interact with it. For example, one could send a red traffic light sign to a program by simply issuing a `SIGTERM` signal.\n\nJust like with a red traffic light, people may choose to continue to walk or drive when the light is red. Whilst that may not be a safe idea for all involved, a `SIGTERM` signal send to a process will do exactly that; the process/program may choose to ignore such a signal.\n\nThe basic Linux signals all have a number (1-30+). After a little while, a proficient Linux user will generally know one or more of these. For example, the `SIGTERM` signal matches with number 15, and signal 9 (`SIGKILL`) is likely the most the most known one as it allows one to forcefully terminate a process, unlike our `SIGTERM` red light example.\n\n![htop displaying possible program signals](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/p/uploads/2021/05/7afbb160-1.png?trim=1,1\u0026bg-color=000\u0026pad=1,1)\n\nHere we see the main screen of `htop` (you can install this handy utility by typing `sudo apt install htop` on Ubuntu/Mint, or `sudo yum install htop` on RedHat/Centos/Fedora) with a number of termination and other signals (lower in the list; there are 37 in total) which can be sent to a process previously selected on the right. One can select a process by pressing the cursor up/down and then send a signal by using F9.\n\n## SIGKILL \u0026 SIGTERM\n\nWhilst the name may sound a little sinister, the common Linux lingo for process termination is that one ‚Äòkills‚Äô a process. Generally speaking, we will only want to terminate a process with a `-9` (`SIGKILL`) signal if such a process/program is hanging. Note that whenever we speak of process or program, the words can be interchanged at will. Basically, a process is any running program (or service) that has been given a _PID_ (a process identifier).\n\nLet‚Äôs look at an example of terminating a running background process by using a `SIGKILL` signal to the running process. Note that as explained `SIGKILL` is rather destructive and will terminate the process no matter what the process would like to do with the signal. A number of signals can be captured and redirected by the process, whereas others cannot.\n\n![Sending SIGKILL to a sleep process running in the background](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/p/uploads/2021/05/586e508f-1.png?trim=1,1\u0026bg-color=000\u0026pad=1,1)\n\nHere we started a `sleep 1800` in the background (using `\u0026` at the end of the command), which was started as the first (`[1]`) background process with `PID 574660`. We subsequently killed that background process using `kill -9 574660`, where the `-9` stands for `SIGKILL`.\n\nWhile the process is terminated immediately, we do not see the termination message (background process `1` killed, i.e., `[1]+ Killed`) as the command prompt returns before the message is displayed, i.e., returning the command line was a faster operation then the process termination, or similar.\n\nWe check the process list by grepping for the PID `ps -ef | grep 574660`. Whilst there is some output, the output shown is only for our running `grep` command; the `sleep` process has already been terminated.\n\nLet‚Äôs evaluate the same with `SIGTERM`, i.e. `kill -15 ${PID}` where `${PID}` is the process we want to terminate.\n\n![Sending SIGTERM to a sleep process running in the background](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/p/uploads/2021/05/59b2900a-2.png?trim=1,1\u0026bg-color=000\u0026pad=1,1)\n\nWe had to press enter to trigger/show the termination message (as explained above). We can see that the program terminated correctly again. However, this time, while invisible for this particular example (read on!), internally inside the `sleep` program code, things went a little different.\n\nIn this case (using `-15` i.e. `SIGTERM` to terminate the process), the `sleep` process was notified and had the opportunity to internally handle the signal. It could subsequently respond by self-terminating, by ignoring the signal, or by any other action as developed into the code. We can also prove this to be true by checking the exit signal and/or output:\n\n![The difference in output and exit codes depending on the signal sent](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/p/uploads/2021/05/9eb60bc8-1.png?trim=1,1\u0026bg-color=000\u0026pad=1,1)\n\nHere we started the process `sleep 2000` twice, and then used another shell/terminal session to terminate the program. The first time, we used `kill -9` and the second time we used `kill -15` to stop the `sleep` process.\n\nWe immediately notice how the output returns `Killed` in the first (`kill -9` action) instance. For the second attempt (using `kill -15`), we see the output `Terminated` instead; the program self-terminated. Subsequent to the respective terminations we also checked the exit signals, and found that the exit codes were different.\n\nWhy is this important? Consider larger programs; in this instance, we were just terminating a simple `sleep` command. There was no data being handled, no traffic being sent back/forth, etc. But what would happen if we sent a `kill -9` command to our database server (this would generally speaking require sudo/root-level privileges)?\n\nIt would trigger the database to go into crash recovery mode the next time it starts up because, as far as the database software knows, all that happened was ‚Äúwas there‚Äù followed by ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù In other words, it crashed. If we had instead issued a `kill -15` command, the database software could have done a controlled shutdown, for example, by first blocking new users from connecting, then disconnecting/terminating existing users, then finish writing data, etc. before finally self-terminating.\n\n## Sending Linux Signals with Keyboard Sequences\n\nDid you know that whenever you sent a `CTRL+C` key sequence to a running program, for example in a terminal, that instead a `SIGINT` is sent? Let‚Äôs step back to our trusted `sleep` command and test this:\n\n![A sleep process interrupted by a SIGINT signal sent via a CTRL+C key sequence](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/p/uploads/2021/05/c00b5755.png?trim=1,1\u0026bg-color=000\u0026pad=1,1)\n\nHere we started `sleep` again, and then pressed the keyboard combination `CTRL+C`. The program terminated, or better _was interrupted_ by the `SIGINT` signal that was sent. We request the exit code and confirm that once again the exit code is different from the previous signals.\n\nNote that this exit code, for sleep, will always be matched to the signal sent, though potentially not all signals may be covered. In other words, when using `CTRL+C` at the command line the exit code will always be `130`, `137` when killed with `kill -9`, and `143` when `kill -15` was used.\n\nYou can test exit codes for commands by querying the `$?` variable, which holds the exit code of the previous command (as long as you have not commenced a new command). Knowing the exit code of a given command in a particular situation, and/or as the result of a particular signal sent to that command, helps when scripting solutions that handle other processes, etc. (which is the case for many shell scripts, especially when managing servers or automated environments).\n\nAnother often-used keyboard sequence is `CTRL+Z`. This will sent a `SIGTSTP` signal, a `suspend` signal which immediately places a process in suspension until (for example) a `'fg'` command is issued for the same process which will bring it back to the foreground.\n\nTo learn more about process management, see [Bash Process Termination Hacks](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/9290/bash-process-termination-hacks/).\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nIn this article, we looked at the most important Linux signals and how we may practically use them in a Linux or Unix environment. Knowing the basic Linux signals aids one with daily Linux use and management, for example, when a process is hanging and needs to be terminated with `kill -9`. In a future article, we may look at capturing a signal using the `trap` command from inside a Bash script, allowing one to define a custom procedure to be executed when such a signal is issued.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, have a look at our Bash automation series starting at [Bash Automation \u0026 Scripting Basics](https://www.cloudsavvyit.com/9676/bash-automation-scripting-basics-part-1/).

Its node-based approach allows to quickly put up some cool-looking thing. But lack of animation knobs makes it difficult to produce animations. I believe I can create custom nodes to compensate for this.\n\n### To discover\n- [[Godot \u0026 Material Maker's GLSL]]\n- Can I just paste [[Shadertoy]] code directly into Global functions?\n- Port groups (those blue buttons)\n- [[Developing an iterator node for Material Maker]]\n\n### Tips\n#### Tricks\n- You can use node's parameters when setting its parameters. [Example](https://pastebin.com/raw/dxJ40rbd). There, `$scale_y` is set to a complicated function. And then `$scale_x` is set to `$scale_y`.\n- A trick with labels - if you type a number and a `:` in the beginning of the label, it will position it to the according row. See `Math` node for example.\n\n#### Variables\n`$time` - gets time. Can be used for animating variables.\n\nTo use a parameter in your shader code it is necessary to prefix it with a dollar sign. So a foo parameter can be referred to by `$foo` or `$(foo)` in the shader code. Gradient parameters need to be used as functions with a single float parameter. So `mygradient` should be referred to as `$mygradient($uv.x)` if you want to spread the gradient on the x axis (`$uv` is an implicit variable used by Material Maker for UV coordinates).\n\n`$uv` can have more than two dimensions. SDF nodes rely on that.\n\n#### Nodes\nNodes that provide random patterns have an implicit *seed* parameter. It is not possible to edit it directly, but moving the node in the graph will change its value. It is possible to freeze the seed value using the small dice button in the node‚Äôs title bar in the graph.\n\n##### Input types\n- V4-\u003eV4 takes `vec4` as input and returns `vec4` (while RGBA takes `vec2`)\n- SDF3D-C is vec3-\u003evec2 (position -\u003e distance + color index)\n\n##### Inputs and Instance functions\nThe ‚ÄúFunction‚Äù checkbox changes the way the code is generated for this input. When set to true, the input is generated as a function and can be used in the `Instance functions` section. If the parameter is false, the input code is inlined. It is not advised to set this parameter to true when not required, because generating functions can have an impact on performance. ^fc1fdc\n\nIn shader code, **inputs** are used as **functions** that take a single `vec2` parameter. For example `$myinput(2.0*$uv+vec2(0.2, 0.3))` refers to `myinput`, scaled and translated.\n\n##### Global functions\nThe Global functions tab is used to define the functions that are necessary to implement the texture generator. Those functions will be included only once (when the node is used of course) and **cannot** use parameters or inputs. This is typically where you will paste the code you prepared in Shadertoy. But they can use Instance functions! And Instance functions can take inputs.\n\n##### Label tricks\nYou can use `n:` in Labels to set the position of a parameter. See `blend` node for example of that.\n\n#### Reference panel\nYou can drag and drop colors everywhere!\n\n### Useful articles and tutorials\n- [Creating custom shader generators](https://rodzilla.itch.io/material-maker/devlog/106374/creating-custom-shader-generators-with-material-maker)\n- [[Intro seminar to Material Maker]] by [[Paulo Falcao]]\n\n### Pitfalls\nWhen editing your custom nodes, ensure to save a *copy* of them, as it might break previous graphs using the older version of those nodes. I still don't understand how your custom nodes are stored in a  `.ptex` file. See [this doc page](https://rodzill4.github.io/material-maker/doc/nodes_common.html).\n\nAlso you can't leave comments in the Main Code section.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/Math":{"title":"Math","content":"\n[[2022-01-04|Jan 4, 22]] oh no redo this shit...\n\n### Subjects\n- [[Linear Algebra]] ^427a3b\n\n### General\n- [[Math resources]]\n\n### Random thingies\n- [[Euler's formula]]\n- [[Bayes's theorem]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/Math-resources":{"title":"Math resources","content":"\n- [mathus.ru](https://mathus.ru/)\n- mathprofi\n- Brilliant\n- [Math for game developers book](https://gamemath.com/book/)\n\n### Random\n- –ó–æ—Ä–∏—á, —Ñ–∏—Ö—Ç–µ–Ω–≥–æ–ª—å—Ü, –∫—É–¥—Ä—è–≤—Ü–µ–≤, —Å–∞–¥–æ–≤–Ω–∏—á–∏–π\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/Matrix-multiplication":{"title":"Matrix multiplication","content":"\ntbd\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/Median":{"title":"Median.md","content":"\ntbd\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/Medicine":{"title":"Medicine","content":"\nAnd it should be a [[Maps of Content|MOC]].\n\n### Articles\n- [Oatly: The New Coke](https://every.to/almanack/oatly-the-new-coke-821556) #toexplore/medicine \n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.346603637Z","tags":null},"/Memory-leaks":{"title":"Memory leaks","content":"\n### Useful Valgrind flags\n- `--leak-check=full`\n- `--trace-children=yes`\n- `--show-leak-kinds=all`\n- `--track-origins=yes`\n- `--verbose`\n- `--log-file=valgrind-out.txt`\n\n### Calling free() after calling exit()\nIn short - not needed for individual programs. All modern OS'es recycle memory allocated to a process when it terminates.\n\n\u003e When your program ends, as in this example, all of the resources assigned to your process are simply recycled/torn down by the operating system. In the case of memory, all of the memory pages that are assigned to you are simply marked as \"free\" and recycled for the use of other processes. Pages are a lower-level concept than what malloc handles - as a result, the specifics of malloc/free are all simply washed away as the whole thing gets cleaned up.\n\u003e \n\u003e It's the moral equivalent of, when you're done using your laptop and want to give it to a friend, you don't bother to individually delete each file. You just format the hard drive.\n\nBUT. If you use your program in a library or some other program, you should take care of resources properly.

It also has a great [[Obsidian plugins|plugin ecosystem]].\n\nYou may notice that some notes a written in a cryptic language or just poorly structured. I hadn't planned to publish them so I was writing for myself. Also some notes are written a long time ago, when I was only learning to write in a Markdown'ish Obsidian flavor instead of infinitely nested lists like in Dynalist. I'm still learning how to properly organize my notes and make them discoverable.\n\nSometimes I don't link a note, because I try to keep backlink count quite low. I think having a lot of backlinks defeats their purpose. So when I have too many, I try to break a note into pieces and link to them.\n\nKeep in mind, if something is not linked, that doesn't mean I don't have a dedicated page for it. I rely heavily on search. Sometimes more than on the backlinks üòÑ\n\nThis website is made with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

For example `foo bar` will find a note that includes both `foo` and `bar` anywhere in it.\n- `\"Quoted strings\"` can be used to search multiple consecutive words separated by space, or in other words, a phrase. So, searching for `\"foo bar\"` with quotes will only find notes that include those words next to each other. You can use backslash `\\\"` to escape double quotes if you actually want to search for a string that includes quotes. And `\\\\` will do the same for backslash.\n- Boolean operations can be used. Use `OR` to match one or another. Use `-` to negate a query. The space character is used for boolean \"and\".\n\t- For example: `foo OR bar` will find all notes that contain either of those words, they don't have to be in the same note. `foo -bar` will find all notes that contain `foo`, but not if they also contain `bar`.\n- Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations. For example `(a OR b) (c OR d)`. This can be useful when crafting complex searches to make sure things happen in the order you want.\n- Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search. Use forward slash to denote a regular expression. For example: `/[a-z]{3}/`.\n\n### Search operators\n\nSeveral special operators are available. Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example: `file:(\"to be\" OR -\"2B\")`.\n\n- `file:` will perform the following subquery on the file name. For example: `file:\".jpg\"`. If you use Zettelkasten-style UIDs, this can be useful for narrowing a time range, for example `file:\"202007\"`for files created in July of 2020.\n- `path:` will perform the following subquery on the file path, absolute from the root. For example: `path:\"Daily Notes/2020-07\"`.\n- `match-case:` and `ignore-case:` will override the case sensitive match logic for the following subquery.\n- `tag:` will search for your specified tag within a file, for example `tag:#work`. This is faster and more accurate than searching for the tag in plaintext `#work`, as it uses the cached information and ignores text in code blocks and sections that aren't markdown text.\n- `line:(...)` will perform the subquery on a line-by-line basis, rather than a file-by-file basis. For example, if you search for `foo bar`, this could match a file that has `foo` in the first paragraph and `bar` in the last paragraph. Searching for `line:(foo bar)` will only match if `foo` and `bar` are on the same line.\n- `block:(...)` will perform the subquery on a block-by-block basis, where each block defined as a markdown block, typically separated by empty lines. This is expensive computationally as it requires parsing each file, which means this is likely slower than other modes.\n- `section:(...)` will perform the subquery on a section-by-section basis, where each section is the text between two headings, including the first heading.\n- `content:(...)` will search file contents only\n\n### Searching blocks and tasks\nYou can do it with `task:` or `block:`. There's also `task-todo:` and `task-done:`. Use `task:\"\"` to match all tasks.

See [[#Links]] - how to use `printf` with multiple threads. Also [[#Output control]].\n\n`usleep` can't take values more than `10^6` because POSIX. But on most systems it will work anyway. More [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12175106).\n\n### What I've learned\nCorner cases can bite you in the ass, hacky ways are dangerous.\nRounding error can be a bitch too. Remember `time_passed()`.\n\n### Problems\n##### Deadlocks\nIf we represent each fork with a mutex, and write an algorithm where each philosophers takes his left fork, then his right fork, all philosophers can take their left forks and get stuck. And die.\n\nSolution - parity. For example, each philosopher with an even index can take his right fork, then his left fork. Or even simpler - the first philosopher takes right fork, then left, while others do the opposite (left, then right).\n\n##### Starvation\nAs forks are not prioritized and philosophers don't speak with each other, it's not guaranteed that a fork will be taken by a philosopher who needs it most. And he can die.\n\n**A hacky solutuion for this particular task:**\nFor even number of philosophers:\nMake a small delay at the start of the simulation for philos with (un)even index. That's it.\n\nFor uneven number of philosophers:\nMake a small delay at the start for philos with uneven index, and a delay for the last philo: `time_to_eat * 2` plus some delta, like 1 ms. And this delay should also be active for the rest of the philos after their first meal.\n\n\n##### Output control\nIf one philosopher dies, then others shouldn't output anything to `stdout`. This would be easy to achieve with `close(1)`, but `close()` is not on the list of allowed functions, so you have to use a mutex for this.\n\n### Functions\n`pthread_create()`\nCreate a thread. Returns 0 on success.\n\n`pthread_join()`\nLike `wait()` for threads. Returns 0 on success.\n\n### Bonus part\nUse named semaphores, create with `sem_open()`. We're not allowed to use `sem_init()` anyway, which is required for an unnamed semaphore.\n\n### Links\n- [The Dining Philosophers Problem With Ron Swanson - adit.io](https://adit.io/posts/2013-05-11-The-Dining-Philosophers-Problem-With-Ron-Swanson.html)\n- [How to use printf() in multiple threads](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23586682)\n- [pthreads - Locking mutex in one thread and unlocking it in the other](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4608843) - it's UB\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.350603631Z","tags":null},"/Philosophy":{"title":"Philosophy","content":"\n[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.350603631Z","tags":null},"/Phrases":{"title":"Phrases.md","content":"\n- Half-assed (half-arsed) - done with little effort or care.

So `wc \u003c file.txt` means `wc` will treat data from `file.txt` as `stdin`.\n\n`2\u003e\u0026` redirects file handle \"2\" (almost always `stderr`) to some other file handle (it's generally written as `2\u003e\u00261`, which redirects `stderr` to the same place as stdout).\n\n`\u0026\u003e` and `\u003e\u0026` redirect both `stdout` and `stderr` to a file.

So `ls \u003e file` and `ls\u003efile` are the same.

My situation is (as is every person's) totally unique, and you cannot take it as typical, nor atypical.\n\nYou may be wondering why you are reading this on pastebin rather than some normal blogging platform. The answer is that my social media accounts are tightly linke to my public persona, and my career would potentially be jeopardized by revealing such information. And pastebin is still a fine tool for anonymous posting.\n\nI graduated in 2010 from a solid non-Ivy university in New England. I was working at a startup during my senior year, about 30 hours a week. At first, I felt like an idiot. It took me weeks to do something that a senior engineer could do in a few hours. I realized quickly that the difference between a junior engineer in his 20's and a senior engineer in his 50's is about 10,000% productivity increase for less than 5x the salary increase. Never deny the truth of the 100x developer (I truly believe it's more like 500x, but that's not the subject of this post).\n\nThat being said, I have always been a ruthless learner, sacrificing my health and relationships for more knowledge. I devoted myself to the startup and study of the technologies used, and let my university grades suffer. By February 2010 of my senior year, the company had succeeded in getting some customers and buzz, raised around $10 million, and extended me an offer for a whopping $46k salary plus a few thousand shares as a Software Engineer.\n\nIt didn't take more than a few conversations and Googles to realize I was seriously low-balled, especially since I intimately knew the architecture of a VC-backed company's platform in a team of only 4 engineers. But my manager was a smart and effective negotiator, and when I finally got the balls to demand more, the conversation ended with me being happy to be getting an offer at all! I got home, realized my mistakes, and vowed to get more \\$\\$\\$.\n\nI found a new job at a shitty company, and did my absolute best to impress at the interview, just so I could get an offer in hand. They asked me what my other company offered, and I said $60k (a lie, I added $14k to the original offer). They offered me $58k plus a $7k performance bonus, for a theoretical $65k package. This new company was owned by private equity, and offered no stock.\n\nI went back to my original employer and said I had a new job offer for $70k, and I didn't want to negotiate, I just wanted their final, last ditch offer. This removed any potential for skilled negotiators to outwit me. Later that night they emailed me an offer for $66k and a few thousand more shares.\n\nI accepted their offer, because that's what I wanted all along.\n\nAfter only 2 weeks of effort and stress, I increased my starting salary by $20k and several thousand more shares. Not too shabby.\n\n1 year passes, and raises come up. My company gives me a 10% raise, bringing my salary to about $73k. Shortly thereafter, my friend graduated from the same university I went to, with worse grades, with significantly less drive, and received a starting salary offer of $75k and decent shares from a medium sized company. I was disgusted by this fact and stewed on it for a few days. I got my nerves up and marched into the CTO's office and demanded a raise, or I would walk. When he asked why, I said it was because starting salaries were higher than what I was being paid, and as I felt I was making key contributions, he could either match it or lose me. He raised me to $80k (not: this time I did not have another offer, which I do not recommend).\n\nOne more year passes. During this time, I was obsessed with software development, and drastically increased my skills and productivity. Dissatisfied with my pay, I answered one of the 5 recruiter requests I received per day on LinkedIn. I found a solid startup, _one_I_would_actually_work_at_, and tell them I make $100k (a lie, I added $20k to my current salary). They match my \"current\" salary and also give 3% equity. (I feel it's key to find a company you would actually work at, so you aren't truly bluffing when you demand more money from your current company and threaten to walk).\n\nI approached my CTO and told him I had another job offer, and if he didn't increase my salary to $100k I would leave. He agreed. After 2 years of professional employment I was making a 6 figure salary. However, I still wasn't satisfied :)\n\n1 more year passes, no raise. I pull the same stunt again, find a new job that offers me $115k, then lie to my current company and say I have an offer for $125k. My company offers $120k, and I accept.\n\n1 more year passes. Serious problems in sales, engineers are leaving en masse. We lose several key people. I wait until the worst possible moment for the survival of my company, and tell them I'm leaving. They not only bump my salary, but promote me to manager! My salary goes to $148k and get many thousands of more shares.\n\nAnd that's where I'm at now. After 5 years of employment, I clawed my way to management, plenty of shares, and about $150k in salary.\n\nI posted this anonymously not to gloat. The goal is to help people realize their true value. I have an engineer working for me who makes $75k, who is absolutely *critical* to our company. If he walked up to me and demanded $50k more tomorrow, I would ultimately accept. But this guy would never do that, and if he did, I would talk him down to something far lower. C'est la vie.\n\nSo in summary, get some balls (and I mean this in the metaphorical sense, for the ladies out there), know your worth, and demand what you are due. I did, and while it did involve some sleepless nights and lots of self-doubt, I ended up for the better.\n\nDon't give up and never settle. Always push yourself and ask for more! It never hurts to interview, and there's no harm in lying about salary. This is capitalism, and no matter how much your company \"values\" you, you will be fired in a nanosecond if push comes to shove and the company's survival is at risk. It is your responsibility to get what you are owed.\n\n~ I hope this helps ~\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.350603631Z","tags":null},"/Sass":{"title":"Sass","content":"\nWatch folder `SCSS` and compile `.scss` to `.css` in folder `CSS`:\n```bash\nsass --watch SCSS:CSS\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.350603631Z","tags":null},"/School-21":{"title":"School 21","content":"\n### Useful pages\n- [[C (language)]]\n- [[MiniLibX]]\n\n### Common core projects\n- [[libft]]\n- [[get_next_line]]\n- [[born2beroot]]\n- [[printf]]\n- [[push_swap]]\n- [[fract-ol]]\n- [[Fdf]] (haven't done)\n- [[minitalk]] (haven't done)\n- [[pipex]]\n- [[Philosophers]]\n- [[minishell]] (in progress)\n\n##### Future\n- [[miniRT]]\n- [[Cube3D]]\n\n### Links\n- [Rating 21](http://42stats.ru/)\n- [–ö–∞–ª—å–∫—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ–π –¥–ª—è –®–∫–æ–ª—ã 21](https://calc21.ru/) (seems to be dead)\n- [42evaluators](https://42evaluators.com/calculator)\n- [mharriso/school21-checklists](https://github.com/mharriso/school21-checklists)\n- [Glagan/42-exam-rank-03](https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03)\n\n### Cool guys\n- [mtiesha](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/mtiesha)\n- [acristin](https://profile.intra.42.fr/users/acristin)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.350603631Z","tags":null},"/Shadertoy":{"title":"Shadertoy","content":"\nA gold mine of really good fragment shaders.\n\n### Resources\n- https://shadertoyunofficial.wordpress.com/ - lots of cool stuff\n\n### Current shaders I'm breaking down\n- [Fractal tree](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtyGDR) by EvilRyu\n\n### Accounts of some cool guys\n- Nimitz (stormoid)\n- [Shane](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Shane/)\n- [Paulo Falcao](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/PauloFalcao)\n- Kali\n- [flockaroo](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/flockaroo)\n- [Evvvvil](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Evvvvil)\n- [Flopine](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Flopine)\n- [Nusan](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/Nusan)\n- [BigWings](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/BigWings) aka The Art of Code\n- [knighty](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/knighty/) - many mathy things!\n\n### Pitfalls\n- [[Shadertoy mysterious bugs]]\n- ANGLE can ruin many things.

It represents the force acting on a unitary charge. If you want to have the actual force acting on an arbitrary charge, you need to multiply the value of the field at a point by that of the charge, and you get Newtons, because that‚Äôs the unit of Force in SI.\n\nConnected with the concept of force/e-field is that of work/voltage. Work is defined as force x distance, and if you divide by charge you get voltage, i.e. force x distance per unit charge, or work per unit charge.\n\nSo you can imagine to calculate force per unit charge, i.e. electric field, as work per unit charge, that is Voltage, divided by distance.\n\nSince work is force x distance, it follows that force is work over (divided by) distance.\n\nSo, the same way you can say that a force of 3 Newton is equivalent to 3 Joule/meter you can apply the same reasoning and say that a field of 3 Newton/Coulomb is same as\n\n3 Joule/(Coulomb x Meter) = 3 Volt/Meter\n\nIt means that the existing field of force will perform 3 Joules of work on a unit charge moving across 1 meter distance.\n\nHope it makes sense!\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/Zig":{"title":"Zig","content":"\nYet another modern C.\n\n### Links\n- [From Go to Zig - Code7](https://c7.se/from-go-to-zig/)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/_-English":{"title":"English","content":"\nThere will be things I learn about this language.\n\n### MOC's\n- [[_ English Spelling]]\n\n### Lists\n- [[Phrases]]\n- [[My English essays]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/_-English-Spelling":{"title":"_ English Spelling.md","content":"\n- [[British vs American#^dee078|British vs American]]\n- [[Sphinx and Sphynx]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/_-Exploration":{"title":"_ Exploration.md","content":"\n### Rabbit holes\n- [This post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-zettelkasten/1999/60) (and the thread overall) on Obsidian forum.

Use `()` to change priority. UPD: `()` actually creates a subshell. So stuff like this is valid:\n```shell\necho foo | (tee | cat)\n```\n\nAccording to the checklist, \"`()` should behave like in Bash\". Goodbye bonus part, then.\n\nSome examples of how Bash does stuff:\n```bash\n$ tee \u003c\u003c eof\n\u003e $PWD\n\u003e '$PWD'\n\u003e \"$PWD\"\n\u003e eof\n/home/psharen/42/minishell/experiments\n'/home/psharen/42/minishell/experiments'\n\"/home/psharen/42/minishell/experiments\"\n\n$ rm foo\\  bar # delete the files named 'foo ' (with a space) and 'bar'\n\n# If there's no space between a quoted string and a command,\n# they're the same word.\n$ e\"cho\" hello\nhello\n\n$ echo \"foo\"bar\nfoobar\n\n$ echo \"hel\"\"lo\"\nhello\n\n$ echo foo \u003e bar \u003e baz # writes \"foo\" to \"baz\", creates empty file \"bar\"\n# if we would remove write access to \"bar\", it would give us error and\n# won't execute further.

We're gonna implement it from scratch in C. [[Managing processes in C]] is also useful here.\n\n### To-do\nLook into [implementation by jbelinda](https://projects.intra.42.fr/projects/pipex/projects_users/2468738).\n\n### Testers\n- [vfurmane/pipex-tester](https://github.com/vfurmane/pipex-tester)\n\n### Functions\n`pid_t fork()`\nCreates a child process. Returns 0 to the child process and child's pid to the parent process or -1 on error. [[File descriptor]] table gets inherited, so that you have access to all the open files via the same descriptors. The descriptors are independent (if you close it in one process, it remains open in the other), but file *description* is shared. So operations like `lseek` take effect in both processes.\n\n`int pipe(int pipefd[])`\nCreates a pipe. Takes an array of two integers, writes two file descriptors in them. `pipefd[0]` is read, `pipefd[1]` is write. On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned, `errno` is set appropriately, and `pipefd` is left unchanged.\n\n`_exit(status)`\n\u003e The basic difference between `exit()` and `_exit()` is that the former performs clean-up related to user-mode constructs in the library, and calls user-supplied cleanup functions, whereas the latter performs only the kernel cleanup for the process.\n([source](https://www.unixguide.net/unix/programming/1.1.3.shtml))\n\nSee [[#Links]] for more details. In short, child processes should call `_exit()`. But I don't really know if I should use it. The parent process should `wait()`, and this command should also free resources (?).\n\n`pid_t wait(int *wstatus)`\n`pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *wstatus, int options)`\nFrom `man 2 wait`:\n\u003e All of these system calls¬†are used to wait for state changes in a child of the calling process, and obtain information about the child whose state has changed.¬†A state change is considered to be: the child terminated; the child was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed by a signal.¬†In the case of a terminated child, performing a wait allows the system to release the resources associated with the child; if a wait is not performed, then the terminated child remains in a \"zombie\" state.\n\n\u003e The `wait()` system call suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.\n\n\u003e If `wstatus` is ¬†not NULL, `wait()` and `waitpid()` store status information in the int to which it points. This integer can be inspected with (...some macros...).\n\n\u003e `wait()`: on success, returns the process ID of the terminated child; on error, -1 is returned.\n\nSo it's enough to just call `wait(NULL)` to wait for one of the child processes to finish.\n\n`dup(), dup2()`\nDuplicate file descriptors. Useful for piping I/O of another program to a file.\n\u003e In general, after a process has had its image swapped out with `exec`, it will have all the open file descriptors it had before `exec`. (Except for those descriptors with the `CLOSE_ON_EXEC` flag set, but ignore that for now). Therefore, if you `dup2` something to `0`, then `wc` will read it. ([Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8860895))\n\n### To-do\n- Don't forget to check absolute paths to commands (e.g. `/usr/bin/wc`).\n- Should I call `close()` if I call `exit()` anyway?\n- How to check for memory leaks in children properly?\n\n### Evaluation\nWhat if some command doesn't exist? Or fails to launch? Or returns an error code? Or crashes?\nWhat if the last argument as a valid command name? What if we launch it multiple times?\nTry with `yes | head`.\nTry with large files (\u003e64MB).\n\n### Notes\n##### Pipes are buffered\nPipes have a write buffer that can fill up. Then it blocks write calls. You should continuously read from a pipe in order for another process to write to it. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55257628). On Mac OS and Linux it's probably around 64 megabytes. It can be extended by the system though.\n\n##### Close unused ends of pipes\nIf a pipe has at least one descriptor referring to its write end, then it remains open. And if some program waits for continuous input, it will keep waiting. So when using `dup2()` to substitute stdin and stdout and then call `exec`, don't forget to close all the fd's.\n\n##### Continuous execution\nContinue execution if some command exits improperly or doesn't exist. Much like bash.\n\n### Examples\n- [Connecting n commands with pipes in a shell?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8082932)\n\n### Links\n- [pipes - wizardzines](https://wizardzines.com/comics/pipes/)\n- [bash redirects - wizardzines](https://wizardzines.com/comics/redirects/)\n- [What is the difference between using _exit() \u0026 exit() in a conventional Linux fork-exec?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5422831/)\n- [Differences between fork and exec](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1653340)\n- [How are pipes implemented in the bash shell?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31527077)\n- [What happens to malloc'ed memory after exec() changes the program image?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5429141)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/pipx":{"title":"pipx","content":"\n`pipx completions` for configuring completions.\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/plugins_installed":{"title":"plugins_installed.md","content":"\n#todo remove this I think\n\n### Plugins\ncalendar\ncm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian\ncycle-through-panes\ndataview\nflashcards-obsidian\nnldates-obsidian\nnote-refactor-obsidian\nobsidian-git\nobsidian-hider\nobsidian-outliner\nobsidian-plugin-toc\nreview-obsidian\nsmart-random-note\n\n### Themes\nAdria.css\nBlue Topaz.css\nCybertron.css\nObsidian gruvbox.css\nRed Graphite.css\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-19T18:30:31.354603625Z","tags":null},"/poetry":{"title":"poetry","content":"\nYet another package manager for Python the language.\n`source $HOME/.poetry/env` to activate.\n\n\u003e [!warning]\n\u003e By default, poetry uses `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs` for storing virtual envs. Bad idea.
