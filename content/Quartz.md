Publish your brain! [[HUGO]] goes brr.

### Bugs
Doesn't link files with `'` in the name.

### Stuff to change
Tags are capitalized ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡

Tags with `-` are rendered weird. If viewed on a page, `-` is a space. So `ducks-swim` becomes `Ducks swim`. But when clicked, it's `Ducks-Swim`. Annoying. Also `ducks/swim` becomes `Ducks swim` when viewed on a page and `Ducks/Swim` when clicked.
