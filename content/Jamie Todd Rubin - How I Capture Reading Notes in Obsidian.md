Basically, he divided his book notes in two folders - "Commonplace Book" and "Library". All his thoughts and remarks are in the first folder, while quotes, author info and etc. are in "Library". And then he links them together.

He wrote a bunch of Python scripts to automate all that and create sort of a database of all things he has read since 1996.  For me personally it would be an overkill.
