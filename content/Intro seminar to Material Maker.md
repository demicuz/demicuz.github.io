### Takeaways
- 26:20 - You can define your own types of inputs/outputs if you edit the source code of MM.
- 45:10 - That blue `f(x)` checkbox in the inputs. Still don't get how that works. Inputs are already functions that can be called with `$uv` or something. See [[Material Maker#^fc1fdc]]
- 56:50 - You can use the `alt` and `ctrl` keys to transform parameters more precisely.
- 1:16 :00 - creating revolution solids. Very wow!
