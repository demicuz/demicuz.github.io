### Passed by value or by reference?
Objects are passed by reference. Strings are too (I think).

### Comparing objects
If you compare them using `==` or `===`, you compare **object references**. If you want to compare the contents, use shallow comparison or deep comparison. There are probably functions in JS for that.
