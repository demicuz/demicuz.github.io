#todo/coding Should somehow add support for shaders. The Mac version has it.

### Building
run `./configure` to generate `Makefile.gen`. Then `make -f Makefile.gen`.

### Usage
Link with `-lXext -lX11`

### Notes
On my laptop it uses [shm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT-SHM) image format.

Default `Colormap`: 32
Default `depth`: 24

Seems like you need to know whether big or little endian your system is to manipulate colors correctly. Nuts.

### Issues
On X11 you have to [wait](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30861472/) until `Expose` event before drawing anything on the screen.

More or less good font I have on my system:
`-bitstream-courier 10 pitch-bold-r-normal--0-0-120-120-m-0-iso8859-1`
