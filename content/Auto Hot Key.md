### My scripts
- [Special symbols](https://gist.github.com/demicuz/bd4d7bd21270e0f93d3ba51b469935c4)

### How-to's
How to launch scripts at windows start-up:
1. Find the script file, select it, and press `Ctrl+C`.
1. Press `Win+R` to open the Run dialog, then enter `shell:startup` and click OK or Enter. This will open the Startup folder for the current user. To instead open the folder for all users, enter `shell:common` startup (however, in that case you must be an administrator to proceed).
1. Right click inside the window, and click "Paste Shortcut". The shortcut to the script should now be in the Startup folder.
