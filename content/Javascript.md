JavaScript is a prototype-based language: there are **no classes** and objects are created using a cloning process. JavaScript is also a dynamic programming language which means that properties can be easily added or removed from an object after its instantiation.

### Notes
I recommend paring React with [Redux](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/10-tips-for-better-redux-architecture-69250425af44), [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) and [RITEway](https://github.com/ericelliott/riteway). I recommend pairing Redux with [Autodux](https://github.com/ericelliott/autodux) and [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).

**Prototypal Inheritance** ↔ objects without classes, and prototype delegation, aka OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects.
