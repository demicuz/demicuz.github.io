### Tips
`about:performance` for memory and CPU usage of individual tabs.

### Issues
Plays a system beep (very loud on my laptop, scared the shit out of me) when searching page and there's zero matches. Really dumb. To turn off - disable `accessibility.typeaheadfind.enablesound` in `about:config`. Or disable system-wide, see [[Emacs]].
