A specification for nicely formatting text files using magic symbols.

### Line breaks
Well, Standard Markdown specifies that a single line break can fuck off. To actually create a line break you have to use **two consecutive spaces**. Yes. Makes formatting stuff a little more painful, and also if you decide to copy stuff in editing mode, you'll copy those. But if you don't use single line breaks, than it's fine. [[Obsidian]] has a nice feature to render single line breaks.
