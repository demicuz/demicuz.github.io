I. Don't. Know. There are so many options, all with trade-offs. Frankly, the most convenient env to write Clojure for me was [[maria.cloud]]. View docs, notebook-like experience, basic paredit, explore nested structures pretty easily. Zero installation and a short learning period.

Another option is Sublime Text with either Clojure Sublimed plugin, or [[Tutkain]]. I incline towards Tutkain, as it has many more features, like viewing source code of clojure libs.

And another option is Emacs/nvim with bells and whistles. The learning curve is insane.

As for REPL output, it's best to use Reveal or Portal.
