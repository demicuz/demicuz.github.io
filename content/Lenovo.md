### Forum
Hello!

I'm really glad that I've found a person with a similar issue. Not to say that I'm happy you have it too, though :)

What BIOS version are you at, 1.12? Does your fan quickly speed up when CPU is under load? You can check this through some stress test with CPU-Z and monitoring with something like Open Hardware Monitor (if you're on Windows).

And how did you set up automatic adjusting on startup and S3 wake-up? I'd really like to do that to.

As for Advanced BIOS, here are detailed instructions:
1. Turn off the laptop, press the power button, press F2 repeatedly to enter BIOS.
2. Press the power button (turns the laptop off)
3. Press these one key at a time:
4. F1 → 1 → Q → A → Z
     
     F2 → 2 → W → S → X
     
     F3 → 3 → E → D → C
     
     F4 → 4 → R → F → V
     
     F5 → 5 → T → G → B
     
     F6 → 6 → Y → H → N
	 
### Updating GPU drivers
On Lenovo driver everything works mostly normal, but colors are tinted. Blue and green are especially ugly.
