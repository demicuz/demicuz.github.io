I plan to publish my notes somehow. It could be done through some wizardy with [[HUGO]] and my [[Obsidian]] pages, but I have to learn how to actually construct a static website out of my Markdown notes. There's [[Obsidian Publish]], but it's not free, duh. The simpler way would be to use [[Logseq]]. It has two options to do this - a static copy of itself, which might be an overkill, and [[Logseq Publish]], which is more of a "blog" and more SEO friendly. #thoughts/pkm ^e9a33f
