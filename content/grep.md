title: "grep"
---

- `-E` - use extended regular expressions, whatever that means
- `-i` - case-insensitive
- `-v` - inVert matches (return those that don't match)
- `-r` - recursive search. Search all files, for example.
- `-n` - print line numers

Search for whole words with `grep "\bmyword\b"`. `\b` means boundaries.

todo something strange happening when using with `watch`. It ignores spaces.
