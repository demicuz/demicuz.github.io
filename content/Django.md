### Notes
Use `timezone.now()` instead of `datetime` stuff.


`python manage.py shell` to open a shell and interact with Django API. Can write stuff to databases!
```Python
# Django provides a rich database lookup API that's entirely driven by
# keyword arguments.
>>> Question.objects.filter(id=1)
<QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>
>>> Question.objects.filter(question_text__startswith='What')
<QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>
```

When sending POST request, use `{% csrf_token %}`. Whatever that means.

`forloop.counter` indicates how many times the `for` tag has gone through its loop.

Should do `.save()` to commit changes to DB.

To create a custom `404` page, just add `404.html` to templates folder. Don't know why this works.
