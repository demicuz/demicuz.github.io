After Wegener and her coauthors took snapshots of their participants' brains, they challenged both the concussion and control groups to a tricky test. The individuals first focused their attention on a screen with an "X" in the center; then, a three-letter word would pop up to either the left or right of the X. Participants would say the word out loud as quickly as possible before moving on to the next round. 

Seems simple enough, but there's a catch.

In most people, the left side of the brain serves as a major hub for language processing, meaning that written words must be wired to the left hemisphere before we can read them aloud. This process unfolds easily when words appear in front of the right eye, which funnels information straight to the left side of the brain. But when words appear in front of the left eye, the word first travels to the right side of the brain and must cross the corpus callosum before it can be read. Crossing from one side of the brain to the other takes time â€” consequently, people take longer to read words that appear on their left side than those on their right.
