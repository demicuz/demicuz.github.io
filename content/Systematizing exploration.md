#important 
I should create some sort of a tag system or a page where I store interesting articles/things that I wan't to dive into. It's... simply too much of this stuff. So I think I would really benefit if it was well-systematized.

There are so many things just on Obsidian forum, sitting there and waiting to be discovered. Or just on a single website/topic (hello, https://sive.rs/), that it will take several days/weeks/months to explore *everything*.
