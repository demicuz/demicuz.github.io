Or Compact Fluorescent Lightbulb.

From [What are the Connections between Mercury and CFLs? | US EPA](https://www.epa.gov/cfl/what-are-connections-between-mercury-and-cfls):
> No mercury is released when the bulbs are intact (i.e., not broken) or in use, but mercury vapor and very small beads of mercury can be released when a CFL isÂ broken.

Sounds optimistic! But... they could have been just lobbying CFLs.
