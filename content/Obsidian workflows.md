### Notes
##### Note categories ^y2ezqwa
There are three ways to categorize notes which I can think of.

**Folders**, but they pollute quick switching bar. Also, what if you have two categories that intersect?

**Tags** are another option. But they pollute tag pane. I think I can avoid that by creating nested tags.

**Referencing** or keeping a [[Maps of Content|MOC]] is what I used the most. But you have to choose between backlinking and constantly amending the MOC. Both options seem to me not optimal.
