title: "Positioning in CSS"

`static` - the default. Not a positioned element
`relative` - doesn't take an element out of [[CSS basics#Flow|flow]]
`absolute` - takes an element out of flow

Note that positioning can change element's perceived width, even if after translation it is normal again. Use `width: 100%` to avoid this effect.
