title: "get_next_line"
---

A project in [[School 21]].

### Log
Thinking about whether or not the buffer should be null-terminated.
UPD on [[2021-11-01|Nov 1st]] - yup, definitely should. It makes a bunch of things much easier to implement.

[[2021-11-05|Nov 5th]] - ok, so the program takes its shape now. I only need to write a couple of functions and that's it. Time for a debug ðŸ¥²

### Notes
Seems like Tripouille tester doesn't check for EOF!
