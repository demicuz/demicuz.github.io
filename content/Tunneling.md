title: "Tunneling"

Tunneling is a method for encapsulating data packets within other data packets so that they go somewhere that they would not go otherwise.


> [!tip] Analogy
> Imagine mailing an envelope inside another envelope, with both envelopes having a different address, so that the internal envelope gets mailed from the external envelope's destination address. That is the general idea of tunneling, except data is contained within packets instead of envelopes.

Some networks are encrypted in order to protect the packets' contents from anyone who might intercept then en route. Encrypted tunnels are called [[VPN]]s. VPN connections between [[Типы сетей LAN, WLAN, PAN, MAN, WAN, VLAN, WMN, VPN#WAN|WAN]]s are more secure than unencrypted tunneling connectons. [[IPsec]] is one common VPN encryption protocol.
