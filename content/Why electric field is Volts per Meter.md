[from Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-does-volt-per-meter-mean-How-is-that-related-to-the-electric-field-Does-it-mean-that-x-volt-remains-per-meter-when-I-put-a-unit-charge-somewhere-in-the-electric-field#:~:text=A%20volt%20is%20a%20joule,joules%20of%20energy%20are%20transferred.)

The Electric field has units of Force per Charge. It represents the force acting on a unitary charge. If you want to have the actual force acting on an arbitrary charge, you need to multiply the value of the field at a point by that of the charge, and you get Newtons, because thatâ€™s the unit of Force in SI.

Connected with the concept of force/e-field is that of work/voltage. Work is defined as force x distance, and if you divide by charge you get voltage, i.e. force x distance per unit charge, or work per unit charge.

So you can imagine to calculate force per unit charge, i.e. electric field, as work per unit charge, that is Voltage, divided by distance.

Since work is force x distance, it follows that force is work over (divided by) distance.

So, the same way you can say that a force of 3 Newton is equivalent to 3 Joule/meter you can apply the same reasoning and say that a field of 3 Newton/Coulomb is same as

3 Joule/(Coulomb x Meter) = 3 Volt/Meter

It means that the existing field of force will perform 3 Joules of work on a unit charge moving across 1 meter distance.

Hope it makes sense!
