### Changes I've made
`Right Alt` was  a Compose key, removed this binding. Dunno what that key does anyway. `Caps Lock` is switching layouts. Someday I will remap `Caps Lock` to `Ctrl`, but now this thing acts weirdly. In Sublime, when I switch tabs with `Alt + Tab`, tab order is messed up. In terminals `Ctrl + Shift + W` doesn't work, unless you release `Shift` first.

**Unbind `Meta` key from application launcher**
Add this to `~/.config/kwinrc`:
```
[ModifierOnlyShortcuts]
Meta=
```
Yes, you **can't** do this through Shortcuts settings. [Source](https://superuser.com/a/1158462).

### Settings I tend to change
Make touchpad pointer faster, enable tap-to-click.

### Widgets
Click and hold to move around. It's really not that obvious.
