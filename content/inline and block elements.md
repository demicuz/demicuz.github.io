title: "inline and block elements in CSS"
---

`inline` elements are placed "like text", in a reading direction (left to right by default). Their width and height are determined by their content and **cannot** be set. Same for background. To solve this, use `inline-block`.

`block` elements occupy all the width given to them. By default they are placed from top to bottom.
