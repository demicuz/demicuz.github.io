#### Special characters
※ ⇆ ⇄ ⇋ ⇌ ▶ ▲ △ ◊ ∴

### Tips
1. Reference a block from any note by typing `[[^^`
2. Embed a block (or a block, or a heading) by using `![[`
3. Reference a heading with `[[NoteName#someheading]]` or with `[[#someheading]]` in the current note. Or use `[[##` for global heading search.
3. To see recent files just open quick switcher
4. [[Search in Obsidian]]
5. [[Useful hotkeys in Obsidian]]
6. Press `Ctrl` and hover over graph nodes to see note previews!

#### Plugins and settings sensitive to folder names
- Daily notes
- Attachments
- Zettelkasten prefixer
- Templates

### Noticed issues
- When a document gets big enough to add a slider on the right, font "crispiness" changes. Seems to affect edit mode only.
- `Alt + arrows` works to navigate forward/backward, but it *shouldn't*! In the Hotkey settings it's `Ctrl + Alt + arrows`. UPD: it doesn't anymore.
