### Notes
- Damage to the brain through hypoxia. Can cause delirium
- Damage to ACE-2 receptors - they're present in the brain regions responsible for consciousness, breathing and blood pressure. Can contribute to delirium too.
- Systemic inflammation. Blood clots form all throughout the body, including the brain. Micro-clots can form and cause bleeding to the brain.
