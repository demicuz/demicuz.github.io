*Let the Holy War begin!*

I haven't used [[Emacs]] at all, and [[VIM]] for a little bit. As for the editor's way of navigation and editing text, I think VIM is faster and more comfortable. Also Emacs standard key bindings are nonsense. Although again, I haven't used Emacs at all, so I'm judging from what I've heard or read. Also some people think that VIM is more "snappy" and less bloated than Emacs. Which is pretty logical, bc Emacs is an operating system ðŸ™‚.

But Emacs has cool REPL support, Org mode and other stuff, so I'll definitely try it out some time. Learning editors is definitely not a high priority of learning stuff for me. They're just tools to get the job done. But I think that [[structure editors]] have a big future. They're just extremely hard to design.

UPD: I have used (tried to use) Emacs for like two hours and ugh... What a painful new user experience. I just wanted to write some Clojure, but ended up going down an endless pit of navigation commands, configuring addons, etc, etc. The learning curve is insane. And that ancient ELisp... ugh. I'll better not open this Pandora's box. It will suck out all my time.
