*Let the Holy War begin!*

I haven't used [[Emacs]] at all, and [[VIM]] for a little bit. As for the editor's way of navigation and editing text, I think VIM is faster and more comfortable. Also Emacs standard key bindings are nonsense. Although again, I haven't used Emacs at all, so I'm judging from what I've heard or read. Also some people think that VIM is more "snappy" and less bloated than Emacs. Which is pretty logical, bc Emacs is an operating system ðŸ™‚.

But Emacs has cool REPL support, Org mode and other stuff, so I'll definitely try it out some time. Learning editors is definitely not a high priority of learning stuff for me. They're just tools to get the job done. But I think that [[structure editors]] have a big future. They're just extremely hard to design.
