#todo rewrite this stuff. I use [[Fedora]] now.

[[Software I use]]

### Things I've changed in my [[Kubuntu]]
#### Automatic setting of max CPU temp
Added a small script to KDE autostart menu:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Wait for the GUI to be ready
while [[ ! $(pgrep plasmashell) ]]; do sleep 1; done
sudo /opt/RyzenAdj/ryzenadj --tctl-temp=62 && notify-send "Sucessfully set tctl_temp to 62"
```

Also set it to use `sudo` without password using [this](https://askubuntu.com/questions/197536/running-a-startup-program-in-terminal-with-sudo?rq=1) method and added a custom shortcut to launch it. But after suspend/wakeup cycle this setting breaks. And there's no way under KDE to execute something after wakeup, AFAIK. So I used [this method](https://askubuntu.com/questions/226278/run-script-on-wakeup) and added a small script to `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/`:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

case $1/$2 in
  pre/*)
    # echo "Going to $2..."
    # Place your pre suspend commands here, or `exit 0` if no pre suspend action required
    exit 0
    ;;
  post/*)
    # echo "Waking up from $2..."
    # Place your post suspend (resume) commands here, or `exit 0` if no post suspend action required
    # while [[ ! $(pgrep plasmashell) ]]; do sleep 1; done
        /opt/RyzenAdj/ryzenadj --tctl-temp=62
    ;;
esac
```

#### Changes to [[GRUB]]
Added `iommu=soft` due to [this issue](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202665) that crashes my laptop. *UPD*: removed it, just because it spams errors in `journalctl`. I'm to lazy to figure out whether there's something to worry about, so just restored default GRUB config. UPD2: system freezes returned ü•≤. Kernel version: 5.11.0-41 generic.

#### Other changes
- Set interface scale to 125%
- Enabled REISUB
- Installed various utils (`bmon`, `screenfetch`, `qbittorent`)
- Changed DNS from `127.0.0.53` to smth. But I think this DNS was set up by nginx lol.

Force font DPI setting - It was on, set to 120, but the default is off. Turned it off. Dunno why it was on.
UPD: it seems like it should be set to 120. Turned it back on.

### Dumb fixes
- [hashman.ca :: Repack Zoom .debs to remove the `ibus` dependency](https://hashman.ca/zoom/)
- snaps and flatpacks not added to applications if using [[zsh]]: [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1640514), see comment 38 for a fix.
