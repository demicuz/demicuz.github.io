#todo rewrite this stuff. I use [[Fedora]] now.

- [[Software I use]]
- [[KDE settings I tend to change]]
- [[Stuff to do after Linux installation]]
- [[Software to update by hand]]

### Things I've changed in my [[Kubuntu]] (old)

#### Changes to [[GRUB]]
Added `iommu=soft` due to [this issue](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202665) that crashes my laptop. *UPD*: removed it, just because it spams errors in `journalctl`. I'm to lazy to figure out whether there's something to worry about, so just restored default GRUB config. UPD2: system freezes returned ü•≤. Kernel version: 5.11.0-41 generic.

#### Other changes
- Set interface scale to 125%
- Enabled REISUB
- Installed various utils (`bmon`, `screenfetch`, `qbittorent`)
- Changed DNS from `127.0.0.53` to smth. But I think this DNS was set up by nginx lol.

Force font DPI setting - It was on, set to 120, but the default is off. Turned it off. Dunno why it was on.
UPD: it seems like it should be set to 120. Turned it back on.

### Dumb fixes
- [hashman.ca :: Repack Zoom .debs to remove the `ibus` dependency](https://hashman.ca/zoom/)
- snaps and flatpacks not added to applications if using [[zsh]]: [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1640514), see comment 38 for a fix.
