Google search is pretty SEOed and often leads to mediocre websites with a lot of ads. It really depends on what kind of things you're searching, though. For some stuff, it's better to search [[Reddit]] or [[Twitter]] instead of using Google.

Twitter also has a benefit of leveraging your social graph. I've stumbled many times upon great projects, ideas, etc. here.
