title: "Bootstrap"
---

A [[CSS]] framework to make all websites look similar :)

### General principles
Wrap everything with `container`. Then use `row`s, inside of them - `column`s. Each row constitutes of 12 columns.

You can denote that an element is a column by using either `col`, or `col-{sm/md/..}-{1..12}` for making columns collapse into rows.
