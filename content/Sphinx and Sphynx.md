This is **a Sphynx**. Thanks, Google Images! Sphynxes are both ugly and adorable at the same time.

This is **The Sphinx**, aka Great Sphinx of Giza. You've probably seen the Sphinx in any and all of your Social Studies textbooks from grade school.

So, why the *y* in the **Sphynx**, you'd ask? According to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sphynx), it's *probably an alteration of sphinx; from the cat's appearance*.
