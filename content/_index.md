**Hey there** ðŸ‘‹

These are my personal notes that I take in [[Obsidian]]! I've decided to host them on a website as a little experiment. They are mostly related to programming and Linux, so there's little value for you if you're not interested in this kind of stuff.

[[More about these notes]]

You might want to take a look at:
- [[_ Programming and CS]]
- [[Web programming]]
- [[_ Graphics programming]]
- [[System Administration (Linux)]]
- [[Software I use]]
- [[_ Learning]]

### Tips
- The `# Links` section at the bottom of some notes often has useful info. Sometimes more useful than the note itself.
- You can search with `Ctrl` + `K`
- [[Maps of Content]] begin with `_` (most of the time)
