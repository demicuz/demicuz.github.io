You should engage in it! If you **definitely** know what you're doing, of course. To understand politics, you should spend a lot of time learning how to separate bullshit from actual, meaningful stuff. Learning how to spot manipulations. Sometimes this can be really, really, **really** hard. If that was easy, we wouldn't have Trump supporters. Or Putin.
