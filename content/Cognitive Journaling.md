 The aim of cognitive journaling is to:
 - Describe mental and external events *as they appear* in your consciousness, using an *objective*, *experiential*, *falsifiable* method
 - Observe and highlight the *empiric links* between circumstances, thoughts/beliefs and emotions
 - Challenge your own thinking and open it up to more functional thoughts, thus feeling and behaving better

 ### The ABC model of cognition

^b2803c

 **A**ctivating event -> **B**eliefs -> **C**onsequences
 
 This means that something happens (**A**), you then think something about it (**B**), and then you feel an emotion about the situation or take action on it (**C**).
 
 In this model, every cognitive event happens in a consequential ABC order. Emotions and behaviors are **always** consequences of a previous A → B cycle.
