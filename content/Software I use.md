- [[kitty]] - terminal emulator. But Wezterm is good too. Alacritty sucks.
- [[fish]] shell. Using `zsh` after using `fish` is painful.
- [[Sublime Text]] - a text editor. If [[Intellij]] wasn't so buggy and bloated, I would use it. Maybe I'll dive into [[VIM]] or [[Emacs]] some day, who knows.
- [[Fedora]]. Used [[Kubuntu]] previously.
