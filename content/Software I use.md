- [[kitty]] - terminal emulator. But Wezterm is good too.
- [[fish]] shell. Using `zsh` after using `fish` is painful.
- [[Sublime Text]] - a text editor. If [[Intellij]] wasn't so buggy and bloated, I would use it. Maybe I'll dive into [[VIM]] or [[Emacs]] some day, who knows.
- [[difftastic]] for smart code diffing. It's awesome. Forget about `git diff`.
- [[Fedora]]. Used [[Kubuntu]] previously.
