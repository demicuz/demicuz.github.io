A [[School 21]] project about drawing [[Fractals]].

I hacked around a lot of things. I should've done a proper structure for complex numbers and some helpful functions for arithmetic, but I just didn't want to deal with memory allocation. And a single struct seemed like a hacky approach. I've managed to do without `malloc`. But in [[MiniLibX]] it's used everywhere anyway.
